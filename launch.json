The projected primary payload, DISKSat, will demonstrate sustained very low earth orbit (VLEO) flight and test a unique, 1-meter diameter, disk-shaped satellite bus that is designed to increase on-orbit persistence.","program_description":"","rocket":"Electron","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","footer_left":"Booster identity classified.","footer_right":"Recovery likely (Location TBD).","rocket_fact":"To reach low Earth orbit, any rocket must travel at approximately 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h) sideways.","rocket_visual":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikokoren/mission_control/main/rockets/electron_idle.png","generic_visual":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikokoren/mission_control/main/rockets/generic_idle.png"}
