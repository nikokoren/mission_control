The projected primary payload, DISKSat, will demonstrate sustained very low earth orbit (VLEO) flight and test a unique, 1-meter diameter, disk-shaped satellite bus that is designed to increase on-orbit persistence.","program_description":"","rocket":"Electron","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","footer_left":"Booster identity classified.","footer_right":"Recovery likely (Location TBD).","rocket_fact":"The Electron's body is black because it is made of carbon fiber composite, making it light enough for two people to lift.","rocket_visual":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikokoren/mission_control/main/rockets/empty.png","generic_visual":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikokoren/mission_control/main/rockets/empty.png"}
