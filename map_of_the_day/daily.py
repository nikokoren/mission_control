"""
Picks the map of the day and writes the JSON files TRMNL polls.

Reads pool.json (built by harvest.py) and writes map.json plus one file
per category under today/. The pick is a pure function of
the pool and the date: the same day always yields the same map, so a
device that polls at 07:00 and again at 19:00 sees the same thing, and
re-running this script never reshuffles the screen.

Run locally with:
    python3 map_of_the_day/daily.py
    python3 map_of_the_day/daily.py --date 2026-12-25 --dry-run
    python3 map_of_the_day/daily.py --preview 7     # the next week's picks
