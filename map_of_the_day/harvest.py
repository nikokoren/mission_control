"""
Builds map_of_the_day/pool.json, the candidate pool for the plugin.

Walks a handful of Library of Congress map collections, throws out
everything that would look bad (or be legally awkward) on a 1-bit e-ink
screen, and writes what survives as a compact pool. Nothing here runs on
the day the map is shown: daily.py picks from this file offline, so a bad
day at loc.gov can never blank the screen.

Run it monthly, or by hand:
    python3 map_of_the_day/harvest.py            # full harvest, writes pool
    python3 map_of_the_day/harvest.py --pages 2  # quick smoke test
    python3 map_of_the_day/harvest.py --dry-run  # print stats, write nothing

The LOC search API hands us everything we need in the results array --
title, date, rights flag, and the IIIF image URLs with their pixel
dimensions in the URL fragment. That means one request per 100 records and
no per-item follow-up, which keeps a full harvest around 150 requests.
